# Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website
This project was made as part of my [Machine Learning Basic Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009-in-basic/).<br/>
The basic motivation behind the project was to get a foundations in Programming.

## Dependencies
The project requires API key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), to generate the movie trailer page.

## Usage
Run entertainment_center.py and input the movie titles you want to list on your movie trailer website along with the API Key. Rest is automated by the code.<br/>
Rest of the code is documented for further usage. **Make sure to remove/modify the footer in fresh_tomatoes.py before the use though.**

## Sample Website
I have also added the sample html page generated.<br/><br />
